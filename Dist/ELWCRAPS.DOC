 WHAT IS CRAPS?

 Craps! is a simple single-player Craps implementation that allows users to 
 bet credits on the pass-line.
 
 GAMEPLAY
 
 The game asks users to bet credits (your system must provide credits to users
 in order to use this game) on the pass-line and roll the dice. 
 
 The pass-line bet form of Craps is when you bet in the "come out roll" that 
 you will roll a 7 or 11 (a natural - a win), avoiding 2, 3, or 11 (craps - a
 loss), otherwise the roll becomes a point. Then, in the Point Phase, you must 
 continue to roll until you re-roll your point (a win) or roll a 7 (a loss).
 
 COMMANDS
 
 The in-game commands are simple - enter the amount to bet, and roll!
 
 The following are main menu commands:

 I  ...  Read instructions
 C  ...  Shows number of credits available
 P  ...  Play Craps!
 X  ...  Exits Craps!
 
 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
  
 Simply unzip the module archive to your BBS directory, add it to your menu,
 configure the MSG file to your liking, and start the BBS! It's that easy!
 
 In LEVEL3, you can set a key required to play the game. In LEVEL4, you can
 decide whether or not to show a login message, and set a maximum credit bet.
 LEVEL6 has a number of text blocks to customize.
 
 GAME HISTORY
 
 Craps! was originally written and developed by Rick Hadsall under the Netcom
 Software TPD name (the predecessor to Elwynor Technologies) in 1989. The game
 was distributed as shareware for The Major BBS v5.x. It was shelved until
 being revived along with many other modules in 2004 at the start of The Major
 BBS Restoration Project.
 
 Its first Major BBS 6, Worldgroup 1, and Worldgroup 2 DOS release was in 
 October 2004. In February 2006, it was released for Worldgroup 3.2
 
 In September 2024 it was released for Major BBS V10 and open sourced.
